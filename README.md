# Notes-Express

## Description

This is the first journey of learning backend development with express and creating routes. Learned how to use GET, POST, and DELETE requests. I created routes files to my client server to have a real world approach in organizing larger applications.

## User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

## Mock-Up

The following GIF shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![Existing notes are listed in the left-hand column with empty fields on the right-hand side for the new noteâ€™s title and text.](./Develop/Assets/11-express-homework-demo.gif)

## Installation

These are the installation documentation for the npm modules Express.js https://www.npmjs.com/package/express and UUIDv4 https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuidv4. UUIDv4 is a npm package to create unique ids. Also will need fs module to read, create, update, and delete files.

## Usage

This application allows a person to create notes with an unique Id. The user is allowed to create notes, save them, create new notes, and delete saved notes. 

This is what notes were saved when I used the appication

Then I deleted the note Pizza which you saw in the previous image

Then I wanted to add a new note of my liking which is Burgers

Finally I finished creating that new Burgers note and it is saved
